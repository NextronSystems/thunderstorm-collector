# THOR Thunderstorm Collector Scripts

The Thunderstorm collector script library is a library of script examples that you can use for sample collection purposes.

## thunderstorm-collector Shell Script

A shell script for Linux.

### Requirements

- bash
- wget

### Usage

You can run it like:

```bash
bash ./thunderstorm-collector.sh
```

The most common use case would be a collector script that looks e.g. for files that have been created or modified within the last X days and runs every X days.

### Tested On

Successfully tested on:

- Debian 10

## thunderstorm-collector Batch Script

A Batch script for Windows.

Warning: The FOR loop used in the Batch script tends to [leak memory](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6330519/memory-leak-in-batch-for-loop). We couldn't figure out a clever hack to avoid this behaviour and therefore recommend using the Go based Thunderstorm Collector on Windows systems.

### Requirements

- curl (Download [here](https://curl.haxx.se/windows/))

#### Note on Windows 10

Windows 10 already includes a curl since build 17063, so all versions newer than version 1709 (Redstone 3) from October 2017 already meet the requirements

#### Note on very old Windows versions

The last version of curl that works with Windows 7 / Windows 2008 R2 and earlier is v7.46.0 and can be still be downloaded from [here](https://bintray.com/vszakats/generic/download_file?file_path=curl-7.46.0-win32-mingw.7z)

```bash
