# THOR Thunderstorm Collector

The Thunderstorm collectors allow for easy uploads of files to a THOR Thunderstorm instance.
Information on THOR can be found here: https://www.nextron-systems.com/thor/

The files can be filtered to e.g. upload only specific file extensions. See each collector's 
help for details.
