# THOR Thunderstorm Collector

The Thunderstorm collectors allow for easy uploads of files to a THOR Thunderstorm instance.
Information on THOR can be found here: https://www.nextron-systems.com/thor/

The collectors allow users to select files based on size, age or type.

This repository contains two types of collectors:

- [Scripts](scripts/) written in different script languages, available for Linux, Unix and Microsoft Windows
- An [Thunderstorm Collector](go/) written in Go that can be compiled for numerous target platforms

Visit the links to the respective sub directories for a detailed README on the different collectors.

If you'd like to write your own collector, you can find a Python module named `thunderstormAPI` in [this](https://github.com/NextronSystems/thunderstormAPI) repository.
